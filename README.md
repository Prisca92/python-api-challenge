# python-api-challenge


For Part 1:
Using what I've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals I was abke  to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" First, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator.  I also used the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and my problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

Part 2: 
In this deliverable, I used weather data skills to plan future vacations. I was able to use Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ my Python skills to create map visualizations. I was able to build a script ,and compute a the linear regression for one relationship, in which I followed the similar process for all other charts.
